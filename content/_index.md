I'm a software engineer currently working in the automotive industry, developing BMWâ€™s next generation infotainment system. I'm enthusiastic about problem solving and engineering challenges, while still able to work in customer driven environments. 

At present my interests lie in the fields of image processing, machine learning, graphics computing and the Rust programming language
