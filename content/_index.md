Hello, I'm a software engineer currently working in the automotive industry. Right now I have about two years of experience in developing a sort of a full stack platform for BMW next gen infotainment system. I do love to try to solve engineering challenges while I can still tackle customers problems.

Right now I'm more interested in the fields of image processing, machine learning, graphics computing and the Rust programming language.
